Whenever we hire on our data team we issue a homework challenge. Sometimes the resume will look amazing, but when you actually see how someone does an analysis (if they do it at all) it can greatly change how you see them.

> "When we see really good talent, we want to hire them"

When we hire for an analyst position, each applicant must pass thru the "Burger's and Shakeland Challenge". This is a four question homework challenge provided with a dataset that tests an analysts various abilities of working through a problem.

Want to try your luck? Access the homework [here](#) and enter your answers [here](#). We'll let you know if you got it right and give you feedback on how to improve.
