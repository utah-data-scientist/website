      <description>About After going through starting my data science career in Utah and talking to people interested in getting into data science but not knowing how, I decided to put up this website to help.
This site isn&amp;rsquo;t about teaching you how to do data science &amp;ndash; there are plenty of those out there (Kaggle, YouTube, a million blogs). This site is different because you get to learn about what the workplaces are like here, what tools the teams use and the skills they value to help guide you on your quest into data science.</description>
